# F1database
Formula 1 Database

Problem statement:

To design relational database management system related to Formula1. The system should allow
for efficient querying and analysis of data to generate insights and statistics related to F1 races.
The overall goal of the database is to provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of
F1 race data for analysis and decision-making purposes.

Why do you need a database instead of an excel file?

Formula 1 data has large amount of data (more than 1000 - 25000 rows) and multiple excel sheets
which are interrelated and excel might be slow and difficult to manage and database can handle
large volumes efficiently. Not only that database can provide robust security features than excel
and multiple people can access and update the data at the same time easily. Moreover, we can
also do effective querying in database than Excel using SQL.

Target Users:

The target users of this database system would include F1 fans, race organizers, and media
companies. F1 fans can use the database to get information about past and upcoming races,
teams, drivers, and circuits. Race organizers can use the database to manage and plan races, track
performance metrics, and analyze trends. Media companies can use the database to report on
race events, create content, and provide accurate insights to their audiences.
